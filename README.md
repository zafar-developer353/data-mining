# Data Mining Project: [Project Name]

## Project Overview
This project focuses on applying various **Data Mining** techniques to analyze and extract meaningful insights from [Dataset Name]. It involves cleaning, pre-processing, and visualizing the data, followed by implementing machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition and predictive analysis.

## Steps Involved:
### 1. Data Collection
- Data was collected from [source, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Repository, or a custom dataset].
- The dataset consists of [mention the number of rows and columns] with features including [mention key features].

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Handling missing data**: Used imputation techniques to fill missing values.
- **Data normalization**: Applied feature scaling techniques like Min-Max or Standardization.
- **Feature selection**: Used correlation analysis and PCA to select the most important features.

```python
# Example code for handling missing data
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Handle missing values
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
df_cleaned = pd.DataFrame(imputer.fit_transform(df), columns=df.columns)
